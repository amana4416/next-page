# next page:

_Duration: Two Week Sprint_

next page is platform intended for book lovers to catalog their reading history. In addition to keeping track of their books, avid book readers are able to leave behind notes of why they loved (or didn't) a book! There's no pressure of leaving 'reviews' and brings the fun back to reading!

This project was built in its entirety over the course of two weeks as a part of [Prime Digital Academy's](https://www.primeacademy.io/) 20 week curriculum.

## Approach

With this being such a large project, I spent a lot of time planning and scoping out the project. I also created a timeline to help keep the project on track to ensure the project was completed on time.

##### Wireframes

This is the scope document I used to plan the project. It includes the wireframes and a thorough explaination for everything I planned to include in the app. The scope document also contains the relevant ERD to show how my database tables interacted with one another.
